    <h1>Self-Reflection</h1>
    <p><b>What I Understand: </b>The most difficult piece of information that I have learned and understood in this class would have to be the d3 algorithm and its components. It makes sense to me how all of the pieces fit together in order to bind the data and create new elements. The following table highlights the 6 components and my understanding of them. </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
<th>d.select(" ")</th>
<th>.selectAll(" ")</th>
<th>.data()</th>
<th>.enter()</th>
<th>.append(" ")</th>
<th>.text(function(d) {return d.something})</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
<td>Selects where new elements on page will appear</td>
<td>Select all elements that are about to be created</td>
<td>Select data to be bound</td>
<td>Used to get all missing visual elements and must be an array</td>
<td>Creates and appends data with bound data</td>
<td>Adds decoration</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
<p><b>What I Have Yet to Understand: </b>However, I still struggle with mapping. I understand that mapping applies a function to every array element. However, I am not sure how I was able to use the mapping element to get numbers out of an array. For example, in the penguin problem, I would use the mapping command when I wanted to utilize the numbers of the quiz grades. How does it know how to get the numbers out of the array? Is this something that is part of the definition of the mapping feature? Having done numerous problems with mapping, I recognize when to use it, but I do not feel comfortable explaining exactly how it knows what to do when given an array. </p>
